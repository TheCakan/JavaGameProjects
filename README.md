Games that i've did using Java.

--- FIRST PROJECT ---

First project(Arena PPJJ27) is a battle game that you can fight with monsters in arena.

There are 2 types of weapons 1 is normal and the other one is counter sword against monsters.

Player can use potion to heal himself.

The game is just automatic battle so you can't actually play.

--- SECOND PROJECT ---

To understand second project you can just easily open the pdf file that i uploaded "PPJ Project".

It's a game that you need to collect coins to finish but need to be careful about mines.

Map is random generator map so everytime you open the game the map will be different.
