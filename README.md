Games that I've done using Java.

--- FIRST PROJECT ---

The first project(Arena PPJJ27) is a battle game which you can fight with monsters in an arena.

There are two types of weapons 1 is normal and the other is counterhanded against monsters.

Player can use potions to heal themselves.

The game is just an automatic battle so you can't actually play.

--- SECOND PROJECT ---

To understand the second project, you can easily open the pdf file that I uploaded "PPJ Project".

It's a game which you need to collect coins to finish it, but be careful about mines.

The map is a random generator map, so every time you open the game the map will be different.
